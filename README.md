Program that takes a MOTHER 3 ROM and makes it so the enemy's battle sprites
which use the same data point to the same address.

This saves various KBs, which can be used for something else.

Usage is: FreeSpace.exe rom_path [-v]

The -v parameter makes it so the program reports the new first free address.
